What is StateMgt?
State Management is a technique which is used in web apps to remember the data across request and when
we want to take data from one page of the app to another page in the app.

Why do we need State Mgt?

Web apps work on Http/Https protocol, which is a stateless protocol(doesn't remember anything of the 
previous request to process the current request).
So we need state Mgt to remember data across request.


How do we state management?
We use the following techniques:
1) HttpContext---HttpRequest and HttpResponse
2) HttpCookies,Query Strings,HttpSessions, HttpApplication

Different types of state Mgt:
1) Server Side----- Session, Application
2) Client Side-----Hidden Fields, Cookies,Query String, View State(Asp.net)


MVC---- ViewBag,ViewData,TempData


Tempdata---when we want to pass data from one action to another action as well as controller to view.
If u want tempdata for multiple actions, then avoid TempData and use Sessions instead.
TempData.Keep("key") is used to reusing the TempData.
After keeping, if we want to reuse tempdata again, we shall use TempData.Peek("key"), so that it will be saved without deleting it.

Once the data is taken from TempData we may use it in the action for any purpose like returning content by concatenating the data
or we may it take it to the View using ViewBag or ViewData.

ViewBag and ViewData are 2 ways to transfer data from controller action to the view.
ViewBag uses dynamic feature of c# whereas  ViewData is a dictionary collection which stores data in key value pair.
